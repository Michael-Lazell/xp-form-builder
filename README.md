# Enonic XP Form Builder #

This is an application to enable form-building in Enonic XP.
It has build-in support for Bootstrap, browser defaults and a custom made design.

The code and application are free-to-use under the MIT licence, which basically allows use in both open-source and enterprise applications, as long as a reference to this project is included.

I would appreciate a notice if you use my code, though, as I am interested in how others use it.

NB! Though this project is licenced under the MIT licence, Enonic XP itself is licenced under the GNU GPL licence.

## Prerequisites ##
* Install Enonic XP 6.3.0 or above
* Set the XP_HOME variable to point to your Enonic home folder.

## Installation ##
* Run "gradlew deploy" to install to a local installation.

### Install to server ###
* Run "gradlew build" to build, and then copy the jar-file created under "/build/libs"
